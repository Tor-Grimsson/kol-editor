# Research & Best Practices

**Purpose:** Index and overview for research findings and industry best practices that inform design decisions across the kolkrabbi design system.

> The kolkrabbi design system is informed by comprehensive research from industry-leading design systems, accessibility standards, and modern web development best practices. Each research area is documented in detail in dedicated sub-chapters for easy reference and implementation.

---

## Overview

This research category contains foundational studies that inform every major design decision in the kolkrabbi system. From the harmonic typography philosophy to WCAG compliance guidelines, these documents provide the reasoning behind why we build things the way we do.

### Chapter Index

| Number | Title | Focus |
|--------|-------|-------|
| `6.0.0` | Research Overview (this doc) | Context + migration notes |

## Research Areas

### Active Research (6.x.x)

#### 6.1.0 Data Table Component Research ✅

**Status:** Complete
**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Sources:** UXPin, LogRocket, W3C WAI, WCAG 2.1, CSS-Tricks, MDN, Material Design 3, Carbon, Ant Design

**Comprehensive research on data table best practices covering:**
- Column width strategies (fixed vs. flexible)
- WCAG 2.1 accessibility requirements
- Visual hierarchy and styling approaches
- Typography in tables
- Responsive design patterns
- Interactive states and keyboard navigation

**Key Findings:**
- Avoid fixed pixel widths for accessibility (WCAG 1.4.10 Reflow)
- Use semantic HTML (`<caption>`, `scope` attributes)
- Optimal cell padding: 12-16px
- Consider zebra striping for 10+ row tables
- Monospace typography essential for technical data
- Border radius: 4px (modern aesthetic)

#### 6.2.0 Typography System Research ✅

**Status:** Complete
**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Sources:** Material Design 3, shadcn/ui, Ant Design

**Cross-system analysis of typography scales from three major design systems:**
- Material Design 3: 5-tier semantic naming (Display, Headline, Title, Body, Label)
- shadcn/ui: Utility-first Tailwind approach with simplified hierarchy
- Ant Design: Component-driven typography with CSS variables

**Key Findings:**
- Industry consensus on semantic naming over size-based
- Clear separation between display (marketing) and content (reading) typography
- Material: 15+ variants, shadcn: 8 variants, Kolkrabbi: 17 variants
- Kolkrabbi's 6-variant mono system exceeds Material (2) and shadcn (1)
- Need for large body text (18-20px) for leads/intros

**Kolkrabbi Gaps Identified:**
- Missing `.kol-text-lg` for introductory paragraphs
- No explicit Fine mono variants as classes
- Font family legacy names need cleanup
- Mono weight mismatches (400 vs. available 300/500)

**The Harmonic Philosophy:**
> "Any harmony needs its dissonance, lest there be no resolution. The 10px bridge prevents the large 8→12 jump, while 14px and 18px provide necessary tension against the pure 8/4 foundation."

**Complete Scale:** 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 24, 28, 32, 40, 48, 64, 80, 96px
