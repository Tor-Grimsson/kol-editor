## Issues and Resolutions

### Issue 1: DNS Propagation Delay
**Problem**: Local DNS didn't immediately resolve kolkrabbi.io
**Cause**: ISP DNS cache hadn't updated
**Resolution**: Switched to Google DNS (8.8.8.8) temporarily
**Result**: Immediate access, global propagation within 30 minutes

### Issue 2: "Can't connect to server" Error
**Problem**: Browser couldn't find kolkrabbi.io
**Cause**: DNS still propagating locally
**Resolution**: Used kolkrabbi.vercel.app to verify site working
**Result**: Confirmed site was live, just waiting for local DNS

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
- Systematic audit approach caught all issues early
- Progressive loading pattern for large data worked perfectly
- Comprehensive documentation prevented errors during migration
- Cloudflare SSL/TLS configuration upfront avoided common issues
- Vercel's "Valid Configuration" provided immediate confidence

### What Could Be Improved
- Could have prepared DNS changes documentation earlier
- Should document alternative DNS servers (8.8.8.8) upfront
- Consider staging environment for DNS testing in future

### Recommendations for Future Migrations
- Prepare comprehensive migration documentation first
- Configure SSL/TLS settings before DNS changes
- Use "DNS only" mode during initial migration
- Have alternative DNS servers ready (8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1)
- Use vercel.app URL to verify site independently of DNS
- Expect 30-60 minutes for DNS propagation globally
