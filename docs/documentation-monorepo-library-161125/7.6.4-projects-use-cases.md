### Exmon
**Services:** Branding, Website UI/UX, Illustration
**Year:** 2023

Exmon, headquartered in Iceland, is a software company with a mission to empower businesses in making precise decisions based on real-time data. Originally conceived as a solution to the challenge of "revenue leakage" identified by its parent company, Expectus, Exmon has evolved into a standalone product addressing the depreciation of assets or value, a phenomenon that can occur in various ways.

Facing the need for a distinct identity as it transitioned into promoting itself as a Software as a Service (SaaS) Solution, Exmon embarked on the creation of a new brand.

The objectives included establishing a functional brand with flexibility, designing a user-friendly website, defining a visual style for illustrative elements, refining the product's user interface, and developing brand collateral.

Through collaborative efforts with Exmon's management and marketing team, we successfully crafted this modern brand that embodies trustworthiness, flexibility, and stability. Steering in this new direction, Exmon stays alongside of current trends, technology advances, and design aesthetics of tomorrow—equipped and steady.

### Kaffistofan
**Services:** Visual Identity, Logo Design, Website UI/UX
**Year:** 2023

#### Story
On a journey rooted in passion, curiosity, and the love for coffee, Sverrir Berg, founder, and CEO of Kaffistofan, brings a unique narrative to the Icelandic coffee scene. Inspired by his experiences roasting blends in his garage, researching, and importing beans from all ends of the coffee belt—always sourcing directly from the farm. This Icelandic micro roastery and coffee paraphernalia marketplace, materialised as a manifestation of Sverrir's vision.

Sverrir's goal is not just to sell coffee but to help and educate individuals to articulate and share their coffee preferences within a burgeoning community of coffee knowledge.

#### Visual Identity
Kaffistofan's visual identity is an interplay between hand-drawn elements, subtle grit, and vibrant color palettes, unified by modern grid-based layouts and structural guides, creating a balanced yet playful visual language.

The brand embraces certain visual statements: a love for white spaces, acknowledging that the logo's impact isn't determined by size but thoughtful consideration, an emphasis on knowledgeable education over subjective opinions, and a commitment to being noticed without unnecessary clamor. In the world of Kaffistofan, brand consistency and paced quality take precedence.

The system extends seamlessly across any branding applications, contributing to a cohesive brand experience. Kaffistofan's commitment to user experience and sustainability is evident in its consideration of product packaging, ensuring not only visual appeal but also environmental responsibility.

Kaffistofan is more than a coffee brand—it's a celebration of the intricate and diverse world of coffee, encapsulated in a visual identity that invites exploration, communication, and a shared passion for the beverage we all love.

#### Design System
The logo, a symbolic representation of this journey, embodies this ethos, featuring a straightforward image of a coffee bean roasting in an oven. The intention is clarity, mirroring Kaffistofan's desire for effortless communication in the world of coffee. Simple and to the point, it effortlessly communicates what Kaffistofan stands for: 'We speak coffee—easy.'

Central to Kaffistofan's identity is the interplay between hand-drawn illustrations and vibrant color palettes. This artistic combination, coupled with modern grid-based layouts and balanced typographic system, creates a structured yet playful visual language applied across both product and UI.

The wordmark is set in the distinctive typeface Hillstown Sans, tempered by the practical use of the Google font Rubik. This dual font approach ensures adaptability to different contexts. While Hillstown demands attention, Rubik takes the lead as the primary font, ensuring clarity and legibility. Hillstown, with all of it's two widths present; 1. narrow, 2. wide. Inspired by it's uppercase rigidity and the forms brutality; a variety of lockups were required.

Colors are integral to Kaffistofan's brand identity, serving as visual aid in communication with several touch points; they play a crucial role in mapping the roast journey, and it became apparent early on that a considered color system was required based on a cohesive color ramp, rather then a core brand colors approach with their respective tonal palettes. This color system serves as a key cornerstone to the brand, strategically employed, always appropriate.

**Services:** Visual Identity, Logo Design, Branded House
**Year:** 2024

Founded in 1993, Hugvit is one of the leading providers of case management software, with primary focus on the development of next-generation case and process management systems. They have served organisations in both private and public sectors, and have a global customer base.

Their flagship product is Casedoc, a tool used by courts and judicial institutions around the world. Centralised evidence, data monitoring, privilege structure, people-, role-, and location management. Casedoc provides the infrastructure legal systems need to manage sensitive government data.

Kolkrabbi was commissioned to create a new visual identity for the company, and their suites of products and solutions—that would represent their new mission of transforming digital courts.

**Branded House:** A Branded House is a strategy where more than one company's products are presented under one name/branding umbrella. A logical approach for the project, as it unifies and tightens the brands output with style consistency.

Alongside the branded house, the brief included a visual identity system, a flexible UI/UX design system for the web—representing several different branches, a visual style for illustrative elements, product UI treatment and brand collateral.

In collaboration with Hugvit's management and marketing team we were able to create Canalix, a strong, trustworthy, and elegant brand, yet flexible enough to counter the rigid nature of governmental institutions. Designed with scalability in mind, streamlining future expansions—without compromising brand values or the visual language.

### Flík
**Services:** Personal, Studio, Identity
**Year:** 2024

Flík was born in February 2023 when two former work colleagues, Þórey Rúnarsdóttir and Marta Schluneger, took part in the Icelandic start-up pitch competition, Gulleggið, under the name StitchHero and landed in 3rd place. Since then, they've been on a mission to empower knitters to create the garments of their dreams by building software applications to customize and design knitting patterns.

In Icelandic, the word Flík means garment and is pronounced similarly to the word "fleek" in English. The phrase "on fleek" has recently taken on a colloquial meaning of something being stylish or perfectly suited to a person. And that's what Flík is all about, creating garments that perfectly suit their creator, from customizing fit, to envisioning and creating something entirely new.

They needed a brand identity that would do their vision justice by being stylish and bold, and yet minimalist enough to be flexible and customizable just like the stitches of a knitter.

Their first app is set to launch in the summer of 2024 for iOS and will allow knitters to easily switch out yarns from what's written in a pattern to their desired, perform critical calculations used by creative knitters everyday, and apply those calculations to a project.
