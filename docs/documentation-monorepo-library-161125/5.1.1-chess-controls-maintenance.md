# 5.1.1 — Chess Controls Maintenance Log

**Status**: Complete  
**Category**: Components  
**Content Type**: Implementation Notes

## Summary
Documenting the set of UI fixes completed for the Chess Analysis and Browse Articles search/filter controls. Work focussed on keeping dropdowns, tag filters, and inputs visually consistent with the design-system breakpoints (sm/md/lg) while preserving the responsive behaviour.

## Changes
1. **Dropdown atom**
   - Auto-selects sm/md/lg metrics unless a size prop is provided.
   - Uses unified padding (12/14/16 vertical, constant 24 horizontal), 11/12/14 px mono type, 120% line-height, and absolute active-indicator dot offset.
   - Wrapper owns the background; list inherits it for seamless borders; shadows removed.
2. **Tag filter dropdown**
   - Mirrors the dropdown atom metrics so tag selection behaves identically (same padding, active dot, responsive sizing).
3. **Input atom**
   - Shares the responsive size map with matching typography.
   - Icon padding tied to breakpoint (icons render at 12/14/16 px by default).
   - Background now matches dropdown default (surface-primary) and shifts to secondary when focused; no accent ring.
4. **Chess Analysis controls**
   - Filters arranged with dropdown group on the left, search field fixed at 320 px on the right; stack gracefully on narrow screens.
   - Search input uses the shared atom, so icon spacing and colours remain aligned with the dropdowns.
5. **Browse Articles search**
   - Swapped to the shared Input component to inherit the same specs; icon spacing issues resolved.

## Notes / Follow-up
- Any new control surface should import the shared `Dropdown`/`Input` components to maintain parity.
- TagFilterDropdown still contains bespoke multi-select logic; future refactor could wrap the shared atom to remove duplication.
